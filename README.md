# Express API Template Branch

This repo branch removes all of the customizable content from the Music API Mysql track so it can be used as a template for more API projects. 

Like the main MySQL Music Library API track, this template assumes that you are using a MySQL database run through Docker.

For information on setup, please check the README.md on the Master branch.
